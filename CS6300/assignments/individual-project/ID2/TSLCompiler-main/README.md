The TSLCompiler is a remake of the original [TSLgenerator](https://github.com/alexorso/tslgenerator), a tool used to generate test cases for reference when writing test code. The reasons behind making this edition comes from the limitations of the TSLgenerator, specifically:
- There are situations when certain keywords are ignored due to precedence in the TSL grammar [implemented by the TSLgenerator](https://github.com/alexorso/tslgenerator/blob/master/Docs/TSLgenerator-manual.txt), with no error messages stating this occured.
- While the source code is available, there are four different codebases depending on the Operating System implementing very identical behavior, making it non-trivial to contribute changes.
- Even if the code base was consolidated into one, most of the code is hard to test automatically due to the over-reliance of static variables, and functions that do not return their results by default.

# Goals
The TSLCompiler is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the TSLgenerator, honoring all of the original command-line options. However, this will reject TSL files containing syntax that would generally be accepted, albeit ignored by the TSLgenerator. This is achieved by implementing the grammar explicitly through a Lexer and Parser library.

In addition, the TSLCompiler is developed using the principles behind Test Driven Development/Behavior Driven Development to provide confidence in any proposed changes.

Finally, to remain fairly close to the original C implementation of the TSLgenerator, and to reduce memory leaks, this project utilizes C++.

# Using
Consult [the manual](docs/USER_MANUAL.md) on how to run the TSLCompiler.

It's highly recommended to download and use the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/divark/TSLCompiler/releases/latest).

If they do not work, go to the [Building](#Building) section for compilation instructions.

# Building
# Prerequisites
- A C++ Compiler supporting the C++20 standard (Tested and built with Clang++ on GitHub).
- The Lexer library Flex.
- The Parser library Bison version >= 3.7.
- The fmt library, which can be installed via `meson wrap install fmt`.
- [The Meson Build System](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html).

# Compiling
1. Clone this repository.

## Windows (MSYS2)
2. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
3. Open the MSYS2 CLANG64 application and change to the location of the repository.
4. Install the following packages: `pacman -S bison flex mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-python mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-meson mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-ca-certificates mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang openssl ca-certificates meson git`
5.  Copy the `FlexLexer.h` into the include path for clang64 via `cp /usr/include/FlexLexer.h /clang64/include/`.
    - NOTE: This is a workaround to detect the Flex library. If someone has a better way of detecting this, help would be greatly appreciated!
6.  (Recommended) Install the fmt library with `meson wrap install fmt`
7.  Run `meson setup build`, where `build` is the name of the build directory.

## macOS
2. Install the latest versions of meson, flex and bison.
    - With brew: `brew install meson bison flex`
3. Install the fmt library with `meson wrap install fmt`
4. Run `meson setup --native-file macos-build.ini build`, where `build` is the name of the build directory.

## Linux
2. Install the latest versions of cmake, flex and bison.
    - With apt (Ubuntu, Debian and similar): `sudo apt install libbison-dev bison flex cmake libfl-dev` 
    - With dnf (Fedora and similar): `sudo dnf install bison bison-devel flex libfl-devel cmake`
    - With pacman (Arch Linux and similar): `sudo pacman -S flex bison cmake`
3. Install the latest version of clang++
    - With apt (Ubuntu, Debian and similar): `sudo apt install clang`
    - With dnf (Fedora and similar): `sudo dnf install clang`
    - With pacman (Arch Linux and similar): `sudo pacman -S clang`
4. Install the latest version of meson
    - With apt (Ubuntu, Debian and similar): `sudo apt install meson`
    - With dnf (Fedora and similar): `sudo dnf install meson`
    - With pacman (Arch Linux and similar): `sudo pacman -S meson`
    - NOTE: If the version of meson is too old for the project, install it with `pipx install meson`
5. Install the fmt library with `meson wrap install fmt`
6. Run `meson setup --native-file linux-build.ini build`, where `build` is the name of the build directory.
    - NOTE: `linux-build.ini` expects clang++-19 for the CI/CD. On your own, so as long as clang supports C++20, you can remove the -19.

# Verifying
1. Open the `build` directory from the `Building` step.
2. Run `meson test`.
3. Confirm that all tests are passing as intended.

# Running
1. Open the `build` directory from the `Building` step.
2. Run `meson compile`.
3. Verify that there is now an executable in there called `tslcompiler` if you're on Linux or macOS, `tslcompiler.exe` if you're on Windows.
4. Run `./tslcompiler path/to/input/file`.
